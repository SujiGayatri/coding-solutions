# Thief Trying to Escape

![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Basic-red)

## Problem

A thief trying to escape from jail has to cross  **n**  walls whose heights are given in  **arr[]**. In one jump, he can climb  **x**  feet, but due to the slippery nature of the walls, he slips back by  **y**  feet after every jump. Calculate the total number of jumps required to cross all walls and escape from the jail. After crossing a wall, the thief begins from ground level to cross the next wall.

 **Examples :** 

```
Input: arr[] = {11, 10, 10, 9}, x = 10, y = 1
Output: 5
Explanation: For wall 11, the thief crosses it in 2 jumps. For walls 10, 10, and 9, only 1 jump is needed for each wall. So, total jumps required = 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 5.
```

```
Input: arr[] = {25, 9}, x = 10, y = 2
Output: 4
Explanation: For wall 25, the thief crosses it in 3 jumps. For wall 9, only 1 jump is needed. So, total jumps required = 3 + 1 = 4.
```

**Constraints:
**1 ≤ n ≤ 105 
1 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 104 
1 ≤ y < x ≤ 100

```py
class Solution:
    def totalJumps(self, arr, x, y):
        # code here
        jumps = 0
        net = x - y
        for h in arr:
            if h <= x:
                jumps += 1
            else:
                jumps += 1 + (h - x + net - 1) // net
        return jumps
```
