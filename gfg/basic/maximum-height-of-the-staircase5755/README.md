# Maximum Height of Staircase

![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Basic-red)

## Problem

Given  **n**  square blocks, where each block has a height of 1, construct a staircase of maximum possible height. The first step requires 1 block, the second step requires 2 blocks, the third step requires 3 blocks, and so on. Return the maximum height of the staircase that can be constructed using at most n blocks.

 **Examples:** 

```
Input: n = 10
Output: 4
Explanation: A staircase of height 4 requires: 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10 blocks. Therefore, the maximum possible height is 4.
```

```
Input: n = 16
Output: 5
Explanation: A staircase of height 5 requires: 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 15 blocks. The remaining 1 block is not enough to create the next step, which requires 6 blocks. Therefore, the maximum possible height is 5.

```

```py
class Solution:

    def maxHeight(self, n: int) -> int:
        """code here"""
        left, right = 0, n
        while left <= right:
            mid = (left + right) // 2
            required = mid * (mid + 1) // 2
            if required <= n:
                left = mid + 1
            else:
                right = mid - 1
        return right
```
